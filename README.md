# REPRODUCE-ME
The REPRODUCE-ME ontology extended from PROV-O and P-Plan is used to represent the whole picture of an experiment describing the path it took from its design to result.
This repository contains the experiment datasets and the scripts used for the evaluation and the SPARQL query results of the competency questions.

# ReproduceMe Ontology Network
ReproduceMe is a modular ontology network for the reproducibility of scientific studies. 
The ON is organized in layers and consists of modules that represent different aspects of the provenance of scientific studies.
It consists of foundational, core, and domain-specific ontologies.
PROV-O, P-Plan, ReproduceMe-Core, ReproduceMe-Computational, ReproduceMe-Microscopy, and ReproduceMe-ML are currently the ontologies included in the ReproduceMe Ontology Network. The ontologies can be found [here](https://github.com/Sheeba-Samuel/REPRODUCE-ME/tree/master/ReproduceMeOntologyNetwork)
