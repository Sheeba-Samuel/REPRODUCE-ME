# REPRODUCE-ME
The REPRODUCE-ME ontology extended from PROV-O and P-Plan is used to represent the whole picture of an experiment describing the path it took from its design to result.
This repository contains the experiment datasets and the scripts used for the evaluation and the SPARQL query results of the competency questions.
