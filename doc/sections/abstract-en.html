<h2>Abstract</h2>
<span>The REPRODUCE-ME ontology is an extension of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-o/">PROV-O</a> and the <a href="http://purl.org/net/p-plan#">P-Plan</a> ontology to describe a complete path of a scientific experiment.
It expresses the REPRODUCE-ME Data Model using the OWL2 Web Ontology Language (OWL2).
It provides a set of classes and properties to represent a scientific experiment including its computational and non-computational steps to track the provenance of results.
It describes an experiment and its data, agents, activities, plans, steps, variables, instruments, materials and settings required for its reproducibility.
