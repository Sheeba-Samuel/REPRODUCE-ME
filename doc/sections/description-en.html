<p><a href="#reproduce_me_ontology_example">Figure 1</a>. shows how the REPRODUCE-ME ontology is used to represent the provenance of a scientific experiment. A scientific experiment is represented as a p-plan:Plan which consists of several steps. Each step of a scientific experiment has input and output variables. The ontology also describes how the instruments, materials and settings are linked to the experiment. </p>

<p><a href="#computational_experiment_example">Figure 2</a>. shows how the REPRODUCE-ME ontology is used to represent the provenance of an experiment using computational notebooks. A computational notebook is described as a sub plan of a scientific experiment. The cells in the notebook are considered as p-plan:Step and the execution of each cell is considered as an prov:Activity which uses and generates input and output respectively.
The environmental attributes of the computational experiment is also described using the REPRODUCE-ME Ontology.
