        <h2><b>REPRODUCE-ME: Reproducibility of Scientific Experiments</b></h2>
        <p>Our research provides a list of work done for the Reproducibility of Scientific Experiments.</p>

        <section>
            <h3><b><a href="research/reproduceme.html">1. The REPRODUCE-ME Data Model and Ontology</a></b></h3>
            <p>The REPRODUCE-ME Data Model is a generic data model for the representation of scientific experiments with their provenance information.
              The aim of this model is to capture the general elements of scientific experiments for their understandability and reproducibility.
              An Experiment is considered as the central point of the REPRODUCE-ME data model. The model consists of eight components: Data, Agent, Activity, Plan, Step,
              Setting, Instrument, Material. The REPRODUCE-ME Data Model forms a basis for the REPRODUCE-ME ontology.
              The REPRODUCE-ME ontology extended from PROV-O and P-Plan is used to represent the whole picture of an
              experiment describing the path it took from its design to result.
              We aim to enable end-to-end reproducibility of scientific experiments by capturing and representing
              the complete provenance of a scientific experiment using the REPRODUCE-ME ontology.</p>

        <section>
            <h3><b><a href="research/provbook.html">2. ProvBook</a></b></h3>
            <p>We present ProvBook, an extension of Jupyter Notebook, to capture and view the provenance over the course of time.
              It also allows the user to share a notebook along with its provenance in RDF and also convert it back to a notebook.
              We use the REPRODUCE-ME ontology extended from PROV-O and P-Plan to describe the provenance of a notebook.
              This helps the scientists to compare their previous results with the current ones, check whether the experiments produce the results as expected and query the sequence of executions using SPARQL.
              The notebook data in RDF can be used in combination with the experiments that used them and help to get a track of the complete path of the scientific experiments.</p>

        <section>
          <h3><b><a href="research/caesar.html">3. CAESAR-A Collaborative Environment for Scientific Analysis with Reproducibility</a></b></h3>
          <p>We present CAESAR, a framework for the end-to-end provenance management of scientific experiments. This collaborative framework allows scientists
              to capture, manage, query and visualize the complete path of a scientific experiment
              consisting of computational and non-computational steps in an interoperable way.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3><b><a href="https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.12084393.v1">4. ReproduceMeGit</a></b></h3>
          <p>ReproduceMeGit is a visualization tool for analyzing the reproducibility of Jupyter Notebooks.
            This will help repository users and owners to reproduce and directly analyze and assess the reproducibility of any GitHub repository containing Jupyter Notebooks.
            The tool provides information on the number of notebooks that were successfully reproducible, those that resulted in exceptions, those with different results from the original notebooks, etc.
            Each notebook in the repository along with the provenance information of its execution can also be exported in RDF with the integration of the ProvBook tool.</p>
